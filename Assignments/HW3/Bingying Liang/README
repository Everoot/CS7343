Completing this project will require writing the following Java classes:

FCFS.java       
SJF.java
RR.java
Priority.java
PriorityRR.java

Each of these classes must implement the Algorithm.java interface.

The Program is run as follow:
 java Driver FCFS book.txt
 java Driver SJF book.txt
 java Driver PRI book.txt
 java Driver RR book.txt
 java Driver PRI-RR book.txt
 
The program change the book.txt as other txt, but the schedule of tasks has the form
[task name][priority][CPU burst]
T1, 4, 20
T2, 2, 25
T3, 3, 25
T4, 3, 15
T5, 10, 10

More test schedule store in the test Folder. The more details about the solution of the problem 1 and problem 2 for CS7343 are write in the PDF. The whole project code are in the Code Folder.
